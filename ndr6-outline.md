**Outline**

> Last Thursday we figured out:  We aren't going to introduce any new *modeling formalisms*, so we don't need to put CMF and XSD into separate documents.  We aren't going to introduce new *message serializations* soon, so we don't really need to put NIEM XML and NIEM JSON into separate documents, either.  When we support a new serialization, that will go into a separate document (at least until we suck it into NDR 7).

# 1. Introduction

NIEM, formerly known as the "National Information Exchange Model,‚Äù is a framework for exchanging information among public and private sector organizations. The framework includes a [reference data model](https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/niem-model/v6.0/niem-model-v6.0.html) for objects, properties, and relationships; and a set of technical specifications for using and extending the data model in information exchanges. The NIEM framework supports developer-level specifications of data that form a contract between developers. The data being specified is called a *message* in NIEM. While a message is usually something passed between applications, NIEM works equally well to specify an information resource published on the web, an input or output for a web service or remote procedure, and so forth, basically, any package of data that crosses a system or organization boundary.

NIEM promotes scalability and reusability of messages between information systems, allowing organizations to share data and information more efficiently. It was launched in 2005 in response to the U.S. Homeland Security Presidential Directives to improve information sharing between agencies following 9/11. Until 2023, NIEM was updated and maintained in a collaboration between the U.S. federal government, state and local government agencies, private sector, and non-profit and international organizations, with new versions released around once per year. NIEM defines a set of common objects, the *NIEM Core*, and 17 sets of objects that are specific to certain government or industry verticals, the *NIEM Domains*.

In 2023, NIEM became the NIEMOpen OASIS Open Project. NIEMOpen welcomes participation by anyone irrespective of affiliation with OASIS. Substantive contributions to NIEMOpen and feedback are invited from all parties, following the OASIS rules and the usual conventions for participation in GitHub public repository projects.

NIEMOpen is the term generally used when referring to the organization such as Project Governing Board (PGB), NIEMOpen Technical Architecture Committee (NTAC), NIEMOpen Business Architecture Committee (NBAC), organization activities or processes. NIEM is the term used when directly referring to the model i.e. NIEM Domain, NIEM Model version.

This document specifies principles and enforceable rules for NIEM data components and schemas. Schemas and components that obey the rules set forth here are conformant to specific conformance targets. Conformance targets may include more than the level of conformance defined by this NDR, and may include specific patterns of use, additional quality criteria, and requirements to reuse NIEM release schemas.

# 2. How To Read This Document

This document provides normative specifications for NIEM-conforming data models. It also describes the goals and principles behind those specifications. It includes examples and explanations to help users of NIEM understand the goals, principles, and specifications. The relevant sections of this document will depend on the role of the user. Figure 2-1 illustrates the relationships between these roles and NIEM.

## 2.1 Document references

This document relies on references to many outside documents. Such references are noted by bold, bracketed inline terms. For example, a reference to RFC 3986 is shown as [[RFC 3986]](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/blob/dev/niem-ndr.md#Appendix-A-References). All reference documents are recorded in [Appendix A, References, below](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/blob/dev/niem-ndr.md#appendix-a-references).

## 2.2 Clark notation and qualified names

This document uses both Clark notation and QName notation to represent qualified names.

QName notation is defined by [XML Namespaces] Section 4, Qualified Names. A QName for the XML Schema string datatype is xs:string. Namespace prefixes used within this specification are listed in Section 2.3, Use of namespaces and namespace prefixes, below.

This document sometimes uses Clark notation to represent qualified names in normative text. Clark notation is described by [ClarkNS], and provides the information in a QName without the need to first define a namespace prefix, and then to reference that namespace prefix. A Clark notation representation for the qualified name for the XML Schema string datatype is {http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}string.

Each Clark notation value usually consists of a namespace URI surrounded by curly braces, concatenated with a local name. The exception to this is when Clark notation is used to represent the qualified name for an attribute with no namespace, which is ambiguous when represented using QName notation. For example, the element targetNamespace, which has no [namespace name] property, is represented in Clark notation as {}targetNamespace.

## 2.3 Use of namespaces and namespace prefixes

The following namespace prefixes are used consistently within this specification. These prefixes are not normative; this document issues no requirement that these prefixes be used in any conformant artifact. Although there is no requirement for a schema or XML document to use a particular namespace prefix, the meaning of the following namespace prefixes have fixed meaning in this document.

* `xs`: The namespace for the XML Schema definition language as defined by [XML Schema Structures] and [XML Schema Datatypes], http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.
* `xsi`: The XML Schema instance namespace, defined by [XML Schema Structures] Section 2.6, Schema-Related Markup in Documents Being Validated, for use in XML documents, http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance.
* `ct`: The namespace defined by [CTAS] for the conformanceTargets attribute, </br>https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/conformanceTargets/6.0/.
* `appinfo`: The namespace for the appinfo namespace, https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/appinfo/6.0/.
* `structures`: The namespace for the structures namespace, </br>https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/structures/6.0/.
* `cmf`: The namespace for the CMF model representation, https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/cmf/1.0/.

# 3. Overview of the NIEM Technical Architecture

This overview describes NIEM's design goals and principles. It introduces key features of the architecture that will be defined in more detail later in the document.

## 3.1 Machine-to-machine data specifications

NIEM is a framework for developer-level specifications of data. A NIEM-based data specification ‚Äì which is built *using* NIEM and in *conformance* to NIEM, but is not itself a *part* of NIEM ‚Äì describes data to the developers of producing and consuming systems. This data may be shared via:

* a message passed between applications
* an information resource published on the web
* an API for a system or service

NIEM is potentially useful for any mechanism that transfers a package of data across a system or organization boundary. (Within a large system, NIEM may be useful when data passes between components belonging to different developer teams.)

The primary purpose of a NIEM-based data specification is to establish a common understanding among developers, so that they can write software that correctly handles the shared data, hence "machine-to-machine". (The content of a NIEM message may also be directly presented to human consumers, and NIEM can help these consumers understand what they see, but that is not the main purpose of NIEM.)

In NIEM terms, the package of data shared at runtime is a *message*. A *message type* defines the mandatory and optional information content of a class of messages without prescribing a particular syntax. A *message format* defines a syntax for the content of a message type. Both of these definitions are expressed in terms of a machine-readable *data model*, using either of NIEM's two *modeling formats*, the Common Model Format (CMF) or XML Schema (XSD). A collection of related message formats and types is a *message specification.* The usual case is a message specification with one message type and one message format, but a more complex arrangements is possible, illustrated in figure 3-1 below.

<center>
  <figure class="image">
    <a name="fig3-1"/></a>
    <img src="images/messageSpec.png" alt="figure" style="zoom:100%"/>
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3-1: Message specification, types, and formats</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

> A NIEM message was originally known as an *information exchange package (IEP)*, a term that found its way into the U.S. Federal Enterprise Architecture (2005).  A message specification was originally known as an *information exchange package documentation (IEPD).*  These terms are still in widespread use within the NIEM community today, and will not go away soon (if ever). 

A *message designer* creates a message type and format from an information requirement, so that a message at runtime will contain all the facts that need to be conveyed. Then any number of *message developers* write software to implement the specification, producing or processing messages that conform to the message format. Message designers need some understanding of NIEM, but the message developers do not. (Sometimes the message developers do not even know that NIEM exists.) [Figure 2-1](#fig2-1) above illustrates the relationships between message designers, message developers, and message formats.

NIEM supports XML and JSON message formats; support for other formats may be added in the future. One important feature of NIEM is that messages of the same type are convertable across serializations; for example, a NIEM XML message can be converted to NIEM JSON, and vice versa, with no bespoke programming required. 

## 3.2 Reuse of community-agreed data models

NIEM is also a framework for communities to create data models for concepts that are useful in multiple data specifications. These community models are typically not *complete* for any particular specification. Instead, they reflect the community's judgement on which definitions are *worth the trouble of agreement*. The NIEM core model contains definitions found useful by the NIEM community as a whole. NIEM domain models reuse the core, extending it with definitions found useful by the domain community. The core model plus the domain models comprise the "NIEM model". [Figure 2-2]() above illustrates the relationships between domain communities and community models.

Message designers reuse definitions from the NIEM model, selecting a (usually small) subset of definitions that express part of their information requirement. Message designers then create model extensions, adding definitions that they require but have not (so far!) been found worthy of inclusion in the NIEM model. 

Data model reuse is especially useful in a large enterprise. Its value grows with the number of developer teams, and with the degree of commonality in the shared data. NIEM was originally designed for data sharing among federal, state, and local governments ‚Äì where commonality and number of developer teams is large indeed.

## 3.3 Reuse of open standards

NIEM is built on a foundation of open standards, primarily:

* XML and XSD ‚Äì message serialization and validation; also a modeling formalism
* JSON and JSON-LD ‚Äì message serialization and linked data
* RDF, RDFS, and OWL ‚Äì formal semantics
* ISO 11179 ‚Äì data element conventions

One of NIEM's principles is to reuse well-known information technology standards when these are supported by free and open-source software. NIEM avoids reuse of standards that effectively depend on proprietary software. When the NIEMOpen project defines a standard of its own, it also provides free and open-source software to support it.

## 3.4 The NIEM metamodel

A data model in NIEM defines the syntax and semantics of a message format, or the information content of a message type, or the agreed definitions of a community. The information required for those purposes can itself be modeled. The model of that information is the *NIEM metamodel* -- an abstract model for NIEM data models. The metamodel is expressed in UML, and is described in detail in [section 4](). At a high level, the major components of the metamodel are classes, datatypes, properties, and namespaces. Figure 3-2 provides an lllustration.

  <figure class="image">
    <a name="fig3-2"/></a>
    <img src="images/highLevel.png" style="zoom:75%"/>
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3-2: High-level view of the NIEM metamodel</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

- A *class* defines the content of a corresponding *object* (or *resource*) in a message.
- A *datatype* defines the allowed values of a corresponding atomic *literal value* in a message.
- A class has one or more *properties*. An *object property* defines a subject-predicate-value relationship between an object and another object.  A *data property* defines a relationship between an object and a literal value.
- A *namespace* is a collection of uniquely-named components, described in more detail in section 3.5.

Figure 3-3 below illustrates the relationships among metamodel components, NIEM model components, and the corresponding message objects and values.

<center>
  <figure class="image">
    <a name="fig3-3"/></a>
    <img src="images/msg+meta.png" style="zoom:100%"/>
    <figcaption><i>Figure 3-3: Message object and metamodel components</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

A NIEM message contains objects, properties, and values, which are defined by the Class, Property, and Datatype objects in a NIEM model. In figure 3-3, the name object is defined by the `nc:PersonNameType` Class object; the literal value is defined by the `xs:string` Datatype object, and the property relationship between the two is defined by the `nc:PersonFullName` DataProperty object.

## 3.5 NIEM model representations: XSD and CMF

The abstract metamodel has two concrete representations:  NIEM XSD and NIEM CMF.

XML Schema (XSD) is a NIEM model representation for all versions of NIEM. A NIEM model can be represented as a schema assembled from a collection of schema documents. Every aspect of the metamodel is represented in some way by a schema component. [Section 4](#4-data-models-in-niem) defines the mapping between the metamodel and XSD. [Section 5](#5-modeling-rules-for-niem-xsd) specifies additional rules for the NIEM profile of XSD.

XSD as a model representation supports conformance testing of NIEM XML messages through schema validation. However, JSON developers (and developers working with other formats) cannot use XSD to validate their messages. Nor do they want to read XSD specifications of message content. 

The Common Model Format (CMF) is a second NIEM model representation that supports all developers. CMF is the result of applying the NIEM framework to the information requirements in the metamodel. CMF is a NIEM-based message specification. A CMF model file is a NIEM-based message that represents a NIEM model. [Section 4](#4-data-models-in-niem) defines the mapping between the metamodel and CMF.

Because CMF is a NIEM-based message specification, it can define both an XML format and a JSON format.  CMF examples in this document appear as XML, but can be converted to JSON without loss, and vice versa. 

Because CMF and NIEM XSD are equivalent model representations, NIEM models can be converted from XSD to CMF without loss, and vice versa. 

## 3.6 Namespaces

The components of a NIEM model are partitioned into *namespaces.* This prevents name clashes among communities or domains that have different business perspectives, even when they choose identical data names to represent different data concepts.

Each namespace has an author, a person or organization that is the authoritative source for the namespace definitions. A namespace is the collection of model components for concepts of interest to the namespace author. Namespace cohesion is important; a namespace should be designed so that its components are consistent, may be used together, and may be updated at the same time.

Each namespace must be uniquely identified by a URI. The namespace author should also be the URI's owner, as defined by [ref webarch](). Both URNs and URLs are allowed. It is helpful, but not required, for the namespace URI to be accessible, returning the definition of the namespace content in a supported model format. (See [ref repositories]() for an alternative way to obtain namespace definitions.)

Namespaces are the units of model configuration management. A namespace has one canonical representation in XSD: a [*reference schema document*](#definitions) or [*extension schema document*](#definitions).  A namespace has one canonical representation in CMF: a CMF message, also known as a [*CMF model file*](#definitions). Once published, the components in a namespace may not be removed or redefined. Those changes may only be made in a new namespace with a different URI. As a result, a change by one namespace author does not force a change by any other author ‚Äì the revisions may be adopted, if desired, whenever convenient; the older namespace continues to be valid regardless.

## 3.7 NIEM messages in XML and JSON

The content of a NIEM message may be formatted as XML or JSON. Any NIEM message may be converted from one supported format to another, without loss of information. Figures 3-4 and 3-5 show the equivalent NIEM XML and JSON serializations of the information depicted in figure 3-3.

# 4. Data models in NIEM

The NIEM metamodel is an abstract model, defined in the UML diagram below, that specifies the content of a NIEM data model. CMF is a NIEM message type that implements the metamodel. A CMF message is a representation of a NIEM data model. A NIEM data model may also be represented in NIEM XSD. This section specifies:

* the meaning of the classes, attributes, and relationships in the metamodel
* the meaning of the classes, datatypes, and properties in CMF that implement the metamodel
* the XSD constructs that correspond to CMF classes, datatypes, and properties

    <img src="images/metamodel.png" style="zoom:60%"/>
    <figcaption><i>Figure 4-1:The NIEM metamodel </i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

The table format used to document classes, attributes, relationships, and properties in the metamodel and in CMF has the following columns:

| Column | Definition |
| ------ | ---------- |
| UML | the name of the UML class, attribute, or relationship |
| CMF | the name of the corresponding CMF class or property |
| Definition | the definition of the object or property |
| Card | the cardinality of the property (how many times it may/must appear in an object) |
| Ord | true when the instance order of a repeatable property in an object is significant |
| Range | the class or datatype of a property |

## 4.1 Model class

A Model object represents a complete or partial NIEM model.  (A complete model has a definition for every referenced component.)

<center>
  <figure class="image">
    <a name="fig4-2"/></a>
    <img src="images/modelClass.png" style="zoom:60%"/>
    <figcaption><i>Figure 4-2: Model class diagram</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| Model | ModelType | A data type for a NIEM data model. |
| comp | Component | A data concept for a component of a NIEM data model. | 0..* | - | ComponentType |
| ns | Namespace | A namespace of a data model component | 0..* | - | NamespaceType |

A Model object is represented in CMF as a CMF model file; that is, a CMF message.

A Model object is represented in XSD as a set of XML schema documents. One or more schema documents are provided to begin the set. Other documents are added, according to the @schemaLocation attribute in the import elements in each document encountered. Documents may also be added according to the @namespace attribute, as resolved through XML Catalog files, if provided. There is one namespace object in the model for each namespace defined by the schema documents. The components in each namespace are those specified by the XSD to CMF mappings defined in this section.

## 4.2 Namespace class

A Namespace object represents a namespace in a model. For example, the namespace with the URI `https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/niem-core/6.0/` is a namespace in the NIEM 6.0 model.

  </figure>
</center>

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| Namespace | NamespaceType | A data type for a namespace. ||||
| uri | NamespaceURI | A URI for a namespace. | 1 | - | xs:anyURI |
| prefix | NamespacePrefixText | A namespace prefix name for a namespace. | 1 | - | xs:NCName |
| documentation | DocumentationText | A human-readable text documentation of a namespace. | 1..* | Y | TextType |
| lang | NamespaceLanguageName | A name of a default language of the terms and documentation text in a namespace. | 1 | - | xs:language |
| version | NamespaceVersionText | A version of a namespace; for example, used to distinguish a namespace subset, bug fix, documentation change, etc. | 1 | - | xs:token |
| kind | NamespaceKindCode | A kind of namespace in a NIEM model (external, core, domain, etc.). | 1 | - | NamespaceKindCodeType |
| confTarg | ConformanceTargetURI | A [conformance target identifier](). | 0..* | - | xs:anyURI |
| niemVersion | NIEMVersionText | A NIEM version number of the builtin schema components used in a namespace; e.g. "5" or "6". | 0..1 | - | xs:token |
| docPath | DocumentFilePathText | A relative file path from the top schema directory to a schema document for this namespace. | 0..1 | - | xs:string |
| importDoc | ImportDocumentationText | Human-readable documentation from the first `xs:import` element importing this namespace. | 0..1 | - | xs:string |
| aug | AugmentationRecord | An augmentation of a class with a property by a namespace. | 0..* | - | AugmentationType|
| term | LocalTerm | A data type for the meaning of a term that may appear within the name of a model component. | 0..* | - | LocalTermType |

> Note: I'm now thinking we don't need `NIEMVersionText`. We can work that out from the conformance target assertions.  And we don't need `NamespaceKindCode`. We can work that out from the namespace URI and conformance target assertions -- or if we can't show it's BUILTIN, CORE, DOMAIN, EXTENSION, OTHERNIEM, XML, or XSD, then in a conforming schema pile it must be EXTERNAL. So I think these properties will go away when I have time to fool with it.

Figure 4-4 shows the representation of a Namespace object in CMF and in the corresponding XSD.

**Rule 4-4 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The language name for the first instance of the *documentation* property in any Namespace or Component object MUST be `en-US`.

## 4.4 Class class

A Class object represents an object class in a NIEM model.  For example, `nc:PersonType` is a Class object in the NIEM Core model.

  </figure>
</center>

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| Class | ClassType | A data type for a class. |
| isAbstract | AbstractIndicator | True if a class is a base for extension, and must be specialized to be used directly; false if a class may be used directly. | 0..1 | - | xs:boolean |
| isAugmentable | AugmentableIndicator | True if a  class can be augmented with additional properties. | 0..1 | - | xs:boolean |
| referenceCode | ReferenceCode | A code describing how a property may be referenced (or must appear inline). | 0..1 | - | ReferenceCodeType |
| subClassOf | ExtensionOfClass | A base class of a subclass. | 0..1 | - | ClassType |  
| hasProp | HasProperty | An occurrence of a property as content of a class. | 0..* | Y | HasPropertyType |

There are three special categories of object class:

* An [adapter class](#definitions) contains only properties from a single [external namespace](#definitions).  It acts as a conformance wrapper around data components defined in standards that are not NIEM conforming.  An adapter class has a name ending in "AdapterType".

* An [association class](#definitions) represents a specific relationship between objects.   Associations are used when a simple NIEM property is insufficient to model the relationship clearly, or to model properties of the relationship itself.  An association class has a name ending in "AssociationType".

* An [atomic class](#definition) contains no object properties, one or more [attribute properties](#definitions), and exactly one data property that is not an attribute property.  An atomic class does not have a special name.

Most classes are represented in XSD as a complex type with complex content ("CCC type"); that is, a type with  child elements.  [Figure 4-7](#fig4-7) below shows a Class object represented in CMF, and then in XSD as a complex type with child elements.

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-7"></a>Figure 4-7: A Class object in CMF and in XSD (CCC type)</i></center><p/>

The following table shows the mapping between Class object representations in CMF and XSD.

| CMF | XSD |
| --- | --- |
| Namespace | The namespace object for the containing schema document. |
| Name | `xs:complexType/@name` |
| DocumentationText | `xs:complexType/xs:annotation/xs:documentation` |
| DeprecatedIndicator | `xs:complexType/@appinfo:deprecated` |
| AbstractIndicator | `xs:complexType/@abstract` |
| ExtensionOfClass | `xs:complexType/xs:complexContent/xs:extension/@base` |
| AugmentableIndicator | True if the last element in the sequence is an [*augmentation point*](). |
| ReferenceCode | `xs:complexType/@appinfo:referenceCode` |
| HasProperty | `xs:complexType/xs:complexContent/xs:extension/xs:sequence/xs:element` or `xs:complexType/xs:complexContent/xs:extension/xs:attribute` |

An atomic class is represented in XSD as a complex type with simple content ("CSC type") that has attributes.  This is illustrated in [figure 4-8](#fig4-8) below, which shows an atomic class object in CMF, and then in XSD as a complex type with attributes but no child elements.

```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-8"></a>Figure 4-8: Class object in CMF and XSD (CSC type)</i></center><p/>

An atomic class always has a DataProperty object named after the class, with "Type" replaced by "Literal".  In CMF these appear as two separate objects. In XSD, the representation of an atomic class also represents the DataProperty object. 

## 4.5 HasProperty class

A HasProperty object represents the occurrence of a property in a class. For example, the `nc:PersonType` class object in the NIEM core model has a HasProperty object for the `nc:PersonName` property.

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| HasProperty | HasPropertyType | A data type for an occurrence of a property as content of a class. |
| minOccurs | MinOccursQuantity | The minimum number of times a property may occur within an object of a class. | 1 | - | xs:integer |
| maxOccurs | MaxOccursQuantity | The maximum number of times a property may occur within an object of a class. | 1 | - | MaxOccursType |
| documentation | DocumentationText | A human-readable documentation of a property that is content of a class. | 0..* | Y | TextType |
| isOrdered | OrderedPropertyIndicator | True if the order of a repeated property within an object is significant. | 0..1 | - | xs:boolean |
| augNamespace | AugmentingNamespace | A namespace responsible for augmenting a class with a property. | 0..* | - | NamespaceType |
| property | Property | The property that occurs in the class. | 1 | - | PropertyType |

A HasProperty object is represented in XSD as an element or attribute reference within a complex type definition. Figure 4-9 shows two HasProperty objects in CMF and the corresponding XSD.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<HasProperty>
  <DataProperty structures:ref="ex.PersonMiddleName" xsi:nil="true"/>

<xs:attribute ref="ex:aProperty" use="required"/>
```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-9"></a>Figure 4-9: HasProperty object in CMF and XSD</i></center><p/>

The following table shows the mapping between HasProperty representations in CMF and XSD.

| CMF | XSD |
| --- | --- |
| Property | The property object for `xs:element/@ref`. |
| MinOccursQuantity | `xs:element/@minOccurs` |
| MaxOccursQuantity | `xs:element/@maxOccurs` |
| DocumentationText | `xs:element/xs:annotation/xs:documentation` |
| OrderedPropertyIndicator | `xs:element/@appinfo:orderedPropertyIndicator` |

## 4.6 Property class (abstract)

A Property object represents a data property or an object property in a NIEM model.

    <a name="fig4-10"/></a>
    <img src="images/property.png" style="zoom:60%"/>

  </figure>
</center>

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| Property | PropertyType | A data type for a property. |

| isRelationship | RelationshipPropertyIndicator | True for a property that applies to the relationship between two objects (instead of to a single object). | 0..1 | - | xs:boolean |
| subPropertyOf | SubPropertyOf | A property of which a property is a subproperty. | 0..1 | - | PropertyType |

## 4.7 ObjectProperty class

An ObjectProperty object represents a property with a range that is a class. For example, the `nc:PersonName` object in the NIEM core model is a property with a range of `nc:PersonNameType`.

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| ObjectProperty | ObjectPropertyType | A data type for an object property. |
| referenceCode | ReferenceCode | A code describing how a property may be referenced (or must appear inline). | 0..1 | - | ReferenceCodeType |
| class | Class | The class of this object property. | 1 | - | ClassType |

An ObjectProperty object is represented in XSD as an element declaration with a type that is a Class object. Figure 4-11 shows an ObjectProperty object in XSD and the corresponding CMF.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<ObjectProperty structures:id="ex.ExampleProperty">

```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-11"></a>Figure 4-11: ObjectProperty object in CMF and XSD</i></center><p/>

The following table shows the mapping between ObjectProperty object representations in CMF and XSD.

| CMF | XSD |
| --- | --- |
| Namespace | The namespace object for the containing schema document. |
| Name | `xs:complexType/@name` |
| DocumentationText | `xs:complexType/xs:annotation/xs:documentation` |

| RelationshipPropertyIndicator | `xs:element/@appinfo:relationshipPropertyIndicator`
| Class | The class object for `xs:element/@type` |
| ReferenceCode | `xs:complexType/@appinfo:referenceCode` |

## 4.8 DataProperty class

A DataProperty object represents a property with a range that is a datatype. For example, the `nc:PersonFullName` object shown in [figure 3-3](fig3-3) is a property with a range of `xs:string`.

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| DataProperty | DataPropertyType | 
| isAttribute* | AttributeIndicator | True for a property that is represented as attributes in XML. | 0..1 | - | xs:boolean |
| isRefAttribute* | RefAttributeIndicator | True for a property that is an [object reference attribute](). | 0..1 | - | xs:boolean |
| datatype | Datatype | The datatype of this data property. | 1 | - | DatatypeType |

An [attribute property](#definitions) is a data property in which `isAttribute` is true.  These are represented in XSD as an attribute declaration.

A [reference property](#definitions) is an attribute property that contains a reference to an object in a message.  (Object references are described in [section ref message rules]().)

DataProperty objects are represented in XSD as an attribute declaration, or as an element declaration with a type that is a Datatype object. Figure 4-12 shows the CMF and XSD representations of two DataProperty objects.

    <img src="images/datatype.png" style="zoom:60%"/>
    <figcaption><i>Figure 4-13: Datatype classes</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
</center>

A Datatype object defines the allowed values of a corresponding atomic literal value in a message. Objects for primitive data types, corresponding to the XSD data types, have only the *name*, *namespace*, and *documentation* properties inherited from the Component class. For example, figure 4-14 shows the CMF representation of the `xs:string` primitive data type. All other datatypes are represented by either a Restriction, List, or Union object.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<Datatype>

## 4.10 List class

A List object defines a datatype as a whitespace-separated list of atomic values.

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| List | ListDatatype | A data type for a NIEM model datatype that is a whitespace-separated list of atomic values.||||
| isOrdered | OrderedPropertyIndicator | True if the order of a repeated property within an object is significant. | 0..1 | - | xs:boolean |
| listType | ListOf | The datatype of the atomic values in a list. | 1 | - | DatatypeType |

A List object is represented in XSD as a complex type definition that extends a simple type definition with an `xs:list` element.  Figure 4-15 shows the CMF and XSD representation of a List object.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

| OrderedPropertyIndicator | `xs:complexType/@appinfo:orderedPropertyIndicator` |

## 4.11 Union class

A Union object defines a datatype as the union of one or more datatypes.

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| Union | UnionDatatype | A data type for a NIEM model datatype that is a union of datatypes.
| unionType | UnionOf | A NIEM model datatype that is a member of a union datatype. | 1..* | - | DatatypeType |

A Union object is represented in XSD as a complex type definition that extends a simple type definition with an `xs:union` element. Figure 4-16 shows the XSD and CMF representations of a Union object.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

```

## 4.12 Restriction class

A Restriction object defines a datatype as a restriction of a base datatype plus zero or more restricting Facet objects.

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| Restriction | RestrictionType | A data type for a restriction of a data type. |

## 4.13 Facet class

There are eleven Facet subclasses in the metamodel, and eleven Facet properties in CMF, each with the same meaning as the corresponding eleven constraining facets in XML Schema. 

A Facet object is represented in XSD as one of the twelve XSD constraining facet elements. Each XSD facet element has a corresponding CMF facet object, as shown in the following table.

| XSD element | CMF Facet object | CMF class |
| --- | ---------- | --------- |
| `xs:enumeration`     | Enumeration    | AnyValueFacetType
| `xs:fractionDigits ` | FractionDigits | NonNegativeValueFacetType
| `xs:length`          | Length         | NonNegativeValueFacetType
| `xs:maxExclusive`    | MaxExclusive   | AnyValueFacetType
| `xs:maxInclusive`    | MaxInclusive   | AnyValueFacetType
| `xs:maxLength`       | MaxLength      | NonNegativeValueFacetType
| `xs:minExclusive`    | MinExclusive   | AnyValueFacetType
| `xs:minInclusive`    | MinInclusive   | AnyValueFacetType
| `xs:minLength`       | MinLength      | NonNegativeValueFacetType
| `xs:pattern`         | Pattern        | PatternFacetType
| `xs:totalDigits`     | TotalDigits    | PositiveValueFacetType
| `xs:whiteSpace`      | WhiteSpace     | WhiteSpaceFacetType

The value property of each CMF facet type is represented in XSD as the `@value` attribute of the XSD element; for example, `xs:length/@value`.

The DocumentationText property of each CMF facet type is represented in XSD as the `xs:enumeration/xs:annotation/xs:documentation`.

## 4.14 CodeListBinding class

A CodeListBinding object establishes a relationship between a Restriction object and a code list specification. The detailed meaning of the object properties is provided in [ref code list specification]().

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |

A CodeListBinding object is represented in XSD as a `clsa:SimpleCodeListBinding` element in an `xs:appinfo` element. Figure 4-15 above shows the XSD and CMF representation of a CodeListBinding object. The following table shows the mapping between CodeListBinding object representations in CMF and XSD.

| CMF | XSD |

</center>

Developers of domain schemas and other schemas that build on and extend the NIEM release schemas need to be able to define additional characteristics of common types. For example, the *NIEM Justice* domain, which addresses justice and public safety concerns, considers the following elements to be characteristics of a person, as defined by `nc:PersonType`:

* `j:PersonAdultIndicator`
* `j:PersonForeignNationalIndicator`

There are several approaches that could be used by a domain to add elements to a common type. One method is to have each domain create a subclass of nc:PersonType that adds elements and attributes for the needed content. Some of the problems with this approach include:

* It results in numerous, domain-specific specializations of `nc:PersonType`, each with common content and extension-specific content.

* There is no method for a message designer to bring these types back together into a single type that carries the desired properties. XML Schema does not support multiple inheritance, so there would be no way to join together `nc:PersonType, `j:PersonType`, and `im:PersonType`.

* There is no standard or easy way for the developer to express that the various element instances of the various person types represent the same person, or which parts of those instances are required to be populated; does each person restate the name and birth-date, or is that handled by just one instance?

NIEM's alternative to subclassing is *augmentation*. This is the NIEM mechanism allowing the author of one namespace (the *augmenting namespace*) to add a property to a class in another namespace (the *augmented namespace*) -- without making any change to the augmented namespace. For example:

* `https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/domains/justice/6.0/` is an augmenting namespace
* `https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/niem-core/6.0/` is an augmented namespace
* `j:PersonAdultIndicator` is an *augmentation property*
* `nc:PersonType` is an *augmented class*

The XSD representation of an augmentation is complex, and is explained below. In CMF, an augmentation is represented as an AugmentationRecord object belonging to the augmenting namespace. In this way, each namespace object contains a complete list of all the augmentations it makes.

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| Augmentation | AugmentationRecordType | A data type for a class that is augmented with a property by a namespace. |
| minOccurs | MinOccursQuantity | The minimum number of times a property may occur within an object of a class. | 1 | - | xs:integer |
| maxOccurs | MaxOccursQuantity | The maximum number of times a property may occur within an object of a class. | 1 | - | MaxOccursType |
| index | AugmentationIndex | The ordinal position of an augmentation property that is part of an [augmentation type](). | 0..1 | - | xs:integer |
| global | AugmentedGlobalComponentID | The identifer for a NIEM version and kind of component that is the target of this global augmentation. | 0..1 | - | xs:QName |
| class | Class | The augmented class. | 0..1 | - | ClassType |
| property | Property | The augmentation property . | 1 | - | PropertyType |

For example, augmentation of `nc:PersonType` with `j:PersonAdultIndicator` and `j:PersonForeignNationalIndicator` by the justice namespace results in the following CMF:

<div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<Namespace>
  <NamespaceURI>https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/domains/justice/6.0/</NamespaceURI>
  <NamespacePrefix>j</NamespacePrefix>
  <AugmentationRecord>
    <Class structures:ref="nc.PersonType" xsi:nil="true"/>
    <Property structures:ref="j.PersonAdultIndicator" xsi:nil="true"/>
    <MinOccursQuantity>0</MinOccursQuantity>
    <MaxOccursQuantity>unbounded</MaxOccursQuantity>
    <AugmentationIndex>0</AugmentationIndex>
  </AugmentationRecord>
  <AugmentationRecord>
    <Class structures:ref="nc.PersonType" xsi:nil="true"/>
    <Property structures:ref="j.PersonForeignNationalIndicator" xsi:nil="true"/>
    <MinOccursQuantity>0</MinOccursQuantity>
    <MaxOccursQuantity>unbounded</MaxOccursQuantity>
    <AugmentationIndex>1</AugmentationIndex>
  </AugmentationRecord>  
</Namespace>
```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-19"></a>Figure 4-19: Augmentation object in CMF</i></center><p/>

In CMF, the augmentation property appears in the augmented Class object -- like any other property, except that the augmenting namespace is recorded. For example, augmentation of `nc:PersonType` with `j:PersonAdultIndicator` and `j:PersonForeignNationalIndicator` by the justice namespace results in the following CMF:

 <div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<Class>
  <Name>PersonType</Name>
  <Namespace structures:ref="nc" xsi:nil="true"/>
  <!-- documentation and other HasProperty objects omitted -->
  <HasProperty>
    <DataProperty structures:ref="j.PersonAdultIndicator" xsi:nil="true"/>
    <MinOccursQuantity>0</MinOccursQuantity>
    <MaxOccursQuantity>unbounded</MaxOccursQuantity>
    <AugmentingNamespace>
      https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/domains/justice/6.0/
    </AugmentingNamespace>
  </HasProperty>
  <HasProperty>
    <DataProperty structures:ref="j.PersonForeignNationalIndicator" xsi:nil="true"/>

### 4.15.1 Augmentations in NIEM XSD

Augmentations are represented in NIEM XSD in four different ways, depending on the augmenting property and the augmented class:

* The augmenting property may be represented in XSD by an attribute or by an element.

* The augmented class may be represented in XSD by:

  * a type with child elements -- that is, a complex type with complex content (abbreviated "CCC type")
  
  * a type with an atomic value -- that is, a complex type with simple content (abbreviated "CSC type") 

The four combinations iare described in the following sections:

|     | Augmenting</br> Property | Augmenting</br> Property |
| --- | --- | ---------- | 
| **Augmented</br> Class** | *Element* | *Attribute* |
| *Type with child elements</br> (CCC type)* | [Section 4.15.2](#4152-augmenting-a-ccc-type-with-an-element) and</br> [Section 4.15.3](#4153-augmenting-a-ccc-type-with-an-augmentation-element-only) | [Section 4.15.4](#4154-augmenting-a-ccc-type-with-an-attribute) |
| *Type with an atomic value</br> (CSC type)* | [Section 4.15.5](#4155-augmenting-a-csc-type-with-an-attribute) | [Section 4.15.6](#4156-augmenting-simple-content-with-an-element) |

### 4.15.2 Augmenting a CCC type with an augmentation element and type

Every CCC type in a reference or extension schema document contains an *augmentation point element*, which provides a place for any augmentation properties.

 <div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<xs:complexType name="PersonType">
  <xs:annotation>
    <xs:documentation>A data type for a human being.</xs:documentation>
  </xs:annotation>
  <xs:complexContent>
    <xs:extension base="structures:ObjectType">
      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element ref="nc:PersonBirthDate" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        <xs:element ref="nc:PersonName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        <xs:element ref="nc:PersonAugmentationPoint" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
      </xs:sequence>
    </xs:extension>
  </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
<xs:element name="PersonAugmentationPoint" abstract="true">
  <xs:annotation>
    <xs:documentation>An augmentation point for PersonType.<</xs:documentation>
  </xs:annotation>
</xs:element>
```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-21"></a>Figure 4-21: An augmentation point</i></center><p/>

An augmentation point defined in a reference or extension schema must:
 
- Be in the same namespace as the type
- Have the same name as the type with "Type" replaced by "AugmentationPoint"
- Have unlimited cardinality (minOccurs, maxOccurs unbounded) to support an arbitrary number of augmentations
- Be the last element in the type schema
 
Because an augmentation point is abstract, it cannot appear in messages - it is a placeholder for element substitution only.
 
The augmentation point element may be constrained in subset or message schema documents, or omitted if not needed in a particular message specification.

One way to augment a CCC type with an element is to define:

- An augmentation type to contain the augmenting properties, and
- An augmentation element based on the augmentation type that is substitutable for the augmentation point.

Figure 4-22 shows the XSD for a namespace augmenting `nc:PersonType` with two properties. (The corresponding CMF is shown in figures 4-19 and 4-20 above.)

 <div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<xs:complexType name="PersonAugmentationType">
  <xs:complexContent>
    <xs:extension base="structures:AugmentationType">
      <xs:sequence>
        <xs:element ref="j:PersonAdultIndicator" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        <xs:element ref="j:PersonForeignNationalIndicator" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
      </xs:sequence>
    </xs:extension>
  </xs:complexContent>
</xs:complexType>
<xs:element name="PersonAugmentation" type="j:ExampleAugmentationType" substitutionGroup="nc:PersonAugmentationPoint"/>
```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-22"></a>Figure 4-22: Augmenting a CCC type via an augmentation element and type</i></center><p/>

In an XML message, the augmentation element is only a container for the augmenting properties; it has no meaning of its own. Figure 4-23 shows a NIEM XML message with this augmentation.

 <div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<nc:Person>
  <nc:PersonFullName>Tommy Atkins</nc:PersonFullName>
  <j:PersonAugmentation>
    <j:PersonAdultIndicator>true</j:PersonAdultIndicator>
    <j:PersonForeignNationalIndicator>true</j:PersonForeignNationalIndicator>
  </j:PersonAugmentation>
</nc:Person>
```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-23"></a>Figure 4-23: An XML message from a CCC type with an augmentation element</i></center><p/>

There is no need for the augmentation element in a NIEM JSON message. It does not appear in the equivalent JSON message, shown in figure 4-24 below.

 <div style="font-size:90%;">

```
{
  "nc:Person": {
    "nc:PersonFullName": "Tommy Atkins",
    "j:PersonAdultIndicator": true,
    "j:PersonForeignNationalIndicator": true
  }
}
```

</div>
<center><i><a name="fig4-24"></a>Figure 4-24: A JSON message from a CCC type with an augmentation element</i></center><p/>

### 4.15.3 Augmenting a CCC type with an augmentation element only

Another way to augment a CCC type with an element is to substitute an ordinary element (that is, one that does not have an augmentation type) for the augmentation point. In this case there is no augmentation element in the XML message. Figure 4-25 shows the XSD from the augmenting namespace (`http://example.com/s4figs/`). It also shows the CMF for this augmentation. Figure 4-26 shows an XML message with this augmentation, and the equivalent JSON message.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

```
<xs:element name="PersonFictionalIndicator" type="niem-xs:boolean"
    substitionGroup="nc:PersonAugmentationPoint">

### 4.15.4 Augmenting a CCC type with an attribute

A CCC type is augmented with an attribute property by addding an `xs:attribute` element to the complex type definition. This must be done in a subset schema document for the augmented namespace (and not the reference or extension schema document). The `xs:attribute` element must include *appinfo* to specify the augmenting namespace. Figure 4-27 shows the XSD representation of `nc:PersonType` augmented with the attribute `ex:detectiveIndicator`, and the CMF for this augmentation. Figure 4-28 shows an XML message that includes this augmentation, and the equivalent JSON message.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

### 4.15.5 Augmenting a CSC type with an attribute

A CSC type is also augmented with an attribute property by addding an `xs:attribute` to the complex type definition. This must be done in a subset schema document for the augmented namespace. The attribute reference must include *appinfo* to specify the augmenting namespace. Figure 4-29 shows the XSD representation of `nc:DirectionCodeType` augmented with the attribute `ex:magneticIndicator`, and the equivalent CMF.  Figure 4-30 shows part of an XML message that includes this augmentation, and the equivalent JSON message.

<div style="font-size:90%;">

### 4.15.6 Augmenting a CSC type with an ordinary element

XML simple content cannot contain a child element. A CSC type is augmented with an element property by adding a *reference attribute* to the complex type definition. A reference attribute is a pointer to an element in a message. Figure 4-31 shows the XSD representation of `nc:DirectionCodeType` augmented with the element `nc:Metadata`, and the equivalent CMF.

A property with a name ending in "Ref" is a reference attribute. It refers to an element in the same namespace with the same name, first letter in uppercase, and "Ref" deleted; for example, "nc:metadataRef" points to an "nc:Metadata" element. Figure 4-32 shows part of an XML message that includes the above augmentation, and the equivalent JSON message.

### 4.15.7 Global element augmentations

### 4.15.8 Global attribute augmentations

## 4.16 LocalTerm class

A [*local term*](#definitions) is a word, phrase, acronym, or other string of characters that is used in the name of a namespace component, but that is not defined in [OED](), or that has a non-OED definition in this nameespace, or has a word sense that is in some way unclear. A LocalTerm object captures the namespace author's definition of such a local term. For example, the Justice domain namespace in the NIEM model has a LocalTerm object defining the name "CLP" with documentation "Commercial Learners Permit".

| UML | CMF | Definition | Card | Ord | Range |
| --- | --- | ---------- | :--: | :-: | ----- |
| LocalTerm | LocalTermType | A data type for the meaning of a term that may appear within the name of a model component. |
| name | TermName | The name of the local term. | 1 | - | xs:token |
| documentation | DocumentationText | A human-readable text definition of a data model component or term, or the documentation of a namespace. | 0..1 | - | TextType |
| literal | TermLiteralText | A meaning of a local term provided as a full, plain-text form. | 0..1 | - | xs:string |
| sourceURI | SourceURI | A URI that is an identifier or locator for an originating or authoritative document defining a local term. | 0..* | - | xs:anyURI |
| citation | SourceCitationText | A plain text citation of, reference to, or bibliographic entry for an originating or authoritative document defining a local term. | 0..* | - | xs:string |


A LocalTerm object is represented in XSD by a `appinfo:LocalTerm` element within `xs:appinfo` element in the `xs:schema` element. Figure 4-33 shows a LocalTerm object in XSD and the corresponding CMF.

# 5. Conformance

NIEM defines *conformance* with the rules in this document. NIEM does not define *compliance*. Compliance is assessed by an authority who can compel change or withhold approval. That sort of authoritative assessment is out of scope for NIEMOpen.

This document defines conformance for namespaces, models, and messages. It does not define conformance for applications, systems, databases, or tools. It is therefore impossible for any of these to properly claim "NIEM conformance".  However, they *may* properly claim to generate conforming messages or to employ conforming models.

The rules in this document are designed to be used with or without the definitions in the NIEM model.  They define conformance to the *NIEM architecture*.  Conformance to the *NIEM model* is a separate thing, a matter of reusing components from that model, instead of needlessly duplicating the components therein.  (NIEM model conformance is further described in [[some document]](#references).)

## 5.1 Rules

This document includes a variety of content. Some content of this document is normative, while other content is informative. In general, the informative material appears as supporting text, description, and rationales for the normative material. The terms [normative](#definitions) and [informative](#definitions) are defined in [[ConfReq]](#references).

Rules are normative. In this document, rules appear as follows:
> <b>Rule</b> <i>section <b>-</b> number</i> <b>(</b><i>applicability</i><b>) (</b><i>classification</i><b>)</b></br>



* *section* and *number*: For example, the first rule in section 6 is numbered 6-1.

* *classification*: The kind of rule; one of:

  * **Constraint**: A [constraint rule](#definitions) is a rule that sets a requirement on an artifact with respect to its conformance to a conformance target.

  * **Interpretation**: An [interpretation rule](#definitions) is a rule that sets the methodology, pattern, or procedure for understanding some aspect of an instance of a conformance target.
  
* *applicability*: Identifies the conformance targets to which the rule applies. These are defined in [section 5.2](#52) below.

For example, **Rule 7-1 (XSD)(Constraint):** The document must be an XML Schema document.

Most of the rules in this document apply only to XML Schema documents. These rules amplify and constrain the use of XML Schema, for three reasons:

1. For reuse: To permit XML schema documents created by independent communities to be composed into a single data exchange specification, and to forbid schema constructs that needlessly limit such reuse.

2. For semantics: To impose meaning on the definitions and declarations in a NIEM XML schema document, and on the elements and attributes in a NIEM XML message; and also to forbid those XSD constructs which do not have a useful NIEM interpretation.

3. For developer convenience: To forbid, where consistent with #1 and #2, constructs in XSD that cause difficulties with COTS XML tooling.

There is no comparable need for rules applying to CMF model files.  Rules applicable to CMF are therefore fewer in number.

## 5.2 Conformance targets

The rules in this document are organized into several [*conformance targets*](#definitions). That term is defined by [[CTAS]](#references), as follows:

> A conformance target is a class of artifact, such as an interface, protocol, document, platform, process or service, that is the subject of conformance clauses and normative statements. There may be several conformance targets defined within a specification, and these targets may be diverse so as to reflect different aspects of a specification. For example, a protocol message and a protocol engine may be different conformance targets.

A NIEM namespace, model, or message conforms to the NIEM architecture when it follows all of the rules in the applicable conformance target.

* Targets for *namespaces* apply to each namespace object in a CMF model file, or to a single XSD document
* Targets for *models* apply to an entire CMF model file, or to a set of XSD documents
* Targets for *messages* apply to a NIEM message

The conformance targets in this document are defined in the sections below.  Each conformance target has a three-letter code and a URI, as follows:

* `REF  -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#ReferenceNamespace`
* `EXT  -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#ExtensionNamespace`
* `SUB  -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#SubsetNamespace`
* `MSG  -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#MessageSchemaDocument`
* `SET  -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#Schema`
* `CMF  -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#Model`
* `XML  -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#XMLMessage`
* `JSON -- https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/XNDR/6.0/#JSONMessage`

### 5.2.1 Reference namespace conformance target (REF)

The components in a reference namespace are intended for the widest possible reuse. They provide names and definitions for concepts, and relations among them. These namespaces are characterized by "optionality and over-inclusiveness". That is, they define more concepts than needed for any particular data exchange specification, without cardinalty constraints, so it is easy to select the concepts that are needed and omit the rest. They also omit unnecessary range or length constraints on property datatypes. A reference namespace is intended to capture the meaning of its components. It is not intended for a complete definition of any particular message type or format.

The representation of a reference namespace is authoritative for its components. Once published, those components may not be removed or modified. Therefore there can be only one XSD and one CMF representation of a reference namespace. 

All of the components in the NIEM model are defined according to the rules in this conformance target; that is, within reference namespaces. A data modeler defining an extension to the NIEM model (or an alternative to the NIEM model) may also choose to follow these rules, in order to maximize reusability.

### 5.2.2 Extension namespace conformance target (EXT)

The compnents in an extension namespace are intended for reuse within a more narrow scope than those defined in a reference namespace. An extension namespace expresses the additional vocabulary required for an information exchange, above and beyond the vocabulary available from the NIEM model. Often the intended scope is a particular message specification.

The representation of an externsion namespace is authoritative for its components. Once published, those components may not be removed or modified. Therefore there can be only one XSD and one CMF representation of an extension namespace. 

### 5.2.3 Subset namespace conformance target (SUB)

"Subset namespace" is a shorthand for "subset of components in a reference or extension namespace". A subset namespace is partly for the convenience of message designers and developers, who often prefer to work with a namespace representation that omits the components they do not need. A subset namespace also permits a message designer to provide the cardinality and datatype constraints that precisely define the content of one or more message types. (Those constraints are omitted from reference and extension namespaces to provide more opportunity for reuse.) Finally, a subset namespace allows a message designer to [augment](#4154) a reference or extension namespace with [attribute properties](#definitions).

All message content that is valid for a subset namespace must also be valid for the reference or extension namespace with the same URI.  Wideing the range of a component is not allowed.  With the exception of attribute augmentatons, adding components is not allowed.

There may be any number of XSD or CMF representations of a subset namespace.

### 5.2.4 Message namespace conformance target (MSG)

A message namespace simplifies the representation of a subset namespace.  It is for the convenience of message developers.

The XSD representation of a message namespace is a [message schema document](#definitions).  It is intended to validate the content of an XML message format through cardinality and datatype constraints. It is also intended for schema binding tools (for example, [[JAXB]](#references)). It is not intended to capture the meaning of the schema components; that meaning is found in its reference or extension namespace.  As a result, a message schema document does not require certain XSD constructs that are inconvenient for message developers (for example, substitution groups).

NIEMOpen provides free and open-source software to generate a message schema document from the CMF or XSD representation of a subset namespace.  

The equivalent to a message namespace schema document for JSON messages is a JSON Schema document.  NIEMOpen provides free and open-source software to generate JSON Schema from the CMF or XSD representation of a subset namespace.

### 5.2.5 Schema document conformance target (XSD)

The rules in this conformance target apply to the XSD representation of a reference, extension, subset, or message namespace. Effectively it is a shorthand for (REF,EXT,SUB,MSG).

### 5.2.6 Schema document set conformance target (SET)

The documents in a schema document set are capable of validating an XML document; that is, they can be assembled into a schema according to the rules of [[XML Schema]](#references). The rules in this conformance target are tests for conditions that cannot be evaluated on the basis of a single schema document, but instead apply to the document set as a whole.

### 5.2.7 CMF model file conformance target (CMF)

> NOTE: might not be necessary; will remove if unneeded.

### 5.2.8 XML message conformance target (XML)

### 5.2.9 JSON message conformance target (JSON)

## 5.3 Conformance target assertions

It is often helpful for an artifact to contain an assertion of the kind of thing it is supposed to be.  These assertions can inform both people and tools.  Every NIEM namespace representation contains an assertion of the conformance targets it (allegedly) satisfies.  CMF representations do this through the `ConformanceTargetURI` property in each namespace object.  XSD representations do this through the `ct:conformanceTrgets` attribute, as defined in [[CTAS]] (#references).  Figure 5-1 shows the CMF and XSD representations of a namespace asserting conformance with the reference namespace conformance target (REF).

## 5.4 Testing conformance

Namespaces, models, and messages may be tested for conformance by applying the rules in this document.  Messages may also be tested for conformance to their message format in the following ways:

1. *XML message, XSD model:* Perform XML Schema validation.
2. *XML message, CMF model:* Generate XSD from CMF, perform XML Schema validation.
3. *JSON message, CMF model:* Generate JSON Schema from CMF, perform JSON Schema validation
4. *JSON message, XSD model:* Convert the XSD model to CMF, generate JSON Schema from CMF, perform JSON Schema validation

NIEMOpen provides free and open-source tools to support #2, #3, and #4. These can be found at [ref tools]().

<br/>

# 6. Rules for names of model components

These rules apply to all namespaces.  In a CMF representation, they apply to the Name property of a Component object.  In an XSD representation, they apply to the `{}name` attribute of a complex type definition, element declaration, and attribute declaration.

## 6.1 Rrules based on kind of component

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a model component MUST end in "Type" if and only if it is a Class object or Datatype object. (N5R 11-1,11-2)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a Class object MUST end in "AssociationType" if and only if it is an association class. (N5R 10-21)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a Class object MUST end in "AdapterType" if and only if it is an adapter class. (NEW)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a Property object MUST end in "Association" if and only if its class is an association class. (N5R 10-22)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF)(Constraint):** The name of a Property object MUST end in "Literal" if and only if it is the non-attribute property of an [atomic class](#definitions). (NEW)

**Rule 6-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** The name of an element declaration or attribute declaration MUST NOT end in "Literal". (NEW)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a Property object MUST end in "Ref" if and only if it is a [reference attribute](#definitions) property. (NEW)

## 6.2 Rules for component names

**Rule 6-0 (REF)(Constraint):** Except as otherwise provided in this document, the name of a model component MUST be composed of words from the English language, using the prevalent U.S. spelling, as provided by the Oxford English Dictionary [[OED]](#references). (N5R 10-44)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a model component MUST be entirely composed of the following characters: (N5R 10-46)

* Upper-case letters (A‚ÄìZ)
* Lower-case letters (a‚Äìz)
* Digits (0‚Äì9)
* Underscore (_)
* Hyphen (-)
* Period (.)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a model component that is not an attribute property MUST begin with an uppercase character. (N5W 10-50)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)Constraint):** The name of an attribute property MUST begin with a lowercase character. (N5R 10-49)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a model component MUST use the camel case formatting convention. (N5W 10-48)

Camel case is the convention of writing compound words or phrases with no spaces and an initial lowercase or uppercase letter, with each remaining word element beginning with an uppercase letter. UpperCamelCase is written with an initial uppercase letter, and lowerCamelCase is written with an initial lowercase letter.

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The characters hyphen (-), underscore (_) MUST NOT appear in a component name unless used as a separator between parts of a word, phrase, or value, which would otherwise be incomprehensible without the use of a separator. (N5R 10-47)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The character period (.) MUST NOT appear in a component name unless as a decimal within a numeric value, or unless used as a separator between parts of a word, phrase, or value, which would otherwise be incomprehensible without the use of a separator. (N5R 10-47)

## 6.3 General rules from ISO 11179-5

Names are a simple but incomplete means of providing semantics to data components. Data definitions, structure, and context help to fill the gap left by the limitations of naming. The goals for data component names should be syntactic consistency, semantic precision, and simplicity. In many cases, these goals conflict and it is sometimes necessary to compromise or to allow exceptions to ensure clarity and understanding. To the extent possible, NIEM applies [[ISO 11179-5]](#references) to construct NIEM data component names.

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** A noun used as a term in the name of an XML Schema component MUST be in singular form unless the concept itself is plural. (N5R 10-54)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** A verb used as a term in the name of an XML Schema component MUST be used in the present tense unless the concept itself is past tense. (N5R 10-55)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions MUST NOT be used in NIEM component names except where they are required for clarity or by standard convention. (N5R 10-56)

Articles (e.g., a, an, the), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, but), and prepositions (e.g., at, by, for, from, in, of, to) are all disallowed in NIEM component names, unless they are required. For example, PowerOfAttorneyCode requires the preposition. These rules constrain slight variations in word forms and types to improve consistency and reduce potentially ambiguous or confusing component names.

## 6.4 Property name rules from ISO 11179-5

The set of NIEM data components is a collection of data representations for real-world objects and concepts, along with their associated properties and relationships. Thus, names for these components would consist of the terms (words) for object classes or that describe object classes, their characteristic properties, subparts, and relationships.

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** Except as specified elsewhere in this document, the name of a property object MUST be formed by the composition of object class term, qualifier terms, property term, and representation term, as detailed in Annex A of [[ISO 11179-5]](#references). (N5R 7-5)

For example, the NIEM component name `AircraftFuselageColorCode` is composed of the following:

* Object class term = Aircraft
* Qualifier term = Fuselage
* Property term = Color
* Representation term = Code

### 6.4.1 Object-class term

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The object-class term of a NIEM component MUST consist of a term identifying a category of concrete concepts or entities. (N5R 10-58)

NIEM adopts an object-oriented approach to representation of data. Object classes represent what [ISO 11179-5] refers to as things of interest in a universe of discourse that may be found in a model of that universe. An object class or object term is a word that represents a class of real-world entities or concepts. An object-class term describes the applicable context for a NIEM component.

The object-class term indicates the object category that this data component describes or represents. This term provides valuable context and narrows the scope of the component to an actual class of things or concepts.  An example of a conept term is Activity.  An example of an entity term is Vehicle.

### 6.4.2 Property term

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** A property term MUST describe or represent a characteristic or subpart of an entity or concept. (N5R 10-59)

Objects or concepts are usually described in terms of their characteristic properties, data attributes, or constituent subparts. Most objects can be described by several characteristics. Therefore, a property term in the name of a data component represents a characteristic or subpart of an object class and generally describes the essence of that data component.  It describes the central meaning of the component.

### 6.4.3 Qualifer terms

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** Multiple qualifier terms MAY be used within a component name as necessary to ensure clarity and uniqueness within its namespace and usage context. (N5R 10-60)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The number of qualifier terms SHOULD be limited to the absolute minimum required to make the component name unique and understandable. (N5R 10-61)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The order of qualifiers MUST NOT be used to differentiate components. (N5R 10-62)

Very large vocabularies may have many similar and closely related properties and concepts. The use of object, property, and representation terms alone is often not sufficient to construct meaningful names that can uniquely distinguish such components. Qualifier terms provide additional context to resolve these subtleties. However, swapping the order of qualifiers rarely (if ever) changes meaning; qualifier ordering is no substitute for meaningful terms.

### 6.4.4 Representation term

The representation terms for a property name serve several purposes in NIEM:

1. It can indicate the style of component. For example, types are clearly labeled with the representation term Type.

2. It helps prevent name conflicts and confusion. For example, elements and types may not be given the same name.
 
3. It indicates the nature of the value carried by element. Labeling elements and attributes with a notional indicator of the content eases discovery and comprehension.

The valid value set of a data element or value domain is described by the representation term. NIEM uses a standard set of representation terms in the representation portion of a NIEM-conformant component name. Table 6-1, Property representation terms, below, lists the primary representation terms and a definition for the concept associated with the use of that term. The table also lists secondary representation terms that may represent more specific uses of the concept associated with the primary representation term.

| Primary</br>Representation</br>Term |Secondary</br>Representation</br>Term | Definition | 
| --- | --- | ---------- |
| Amount | - | A number of monetary units specified in a currency where the unit of currency is explicit or implied. |
| BinaryObject | -| A set of finite-length sequences of binary octets. |
| | Graphic	| A diagram, graph, mathematical curves, or similar representation |
| | Picture	| A visual representation of a person, object, or scene | 
| | Sound	| A representation for audio |
| | Video	| A motion picture representation; may include audio encoded within |
|Code	| | 	A character string (i.e., letters, figures, and symbols) that for brevity, language independence, or precision represents a definitive value of an attribute. |
| DateTime | |	A particular point in the progression of time together with relevant supplementary information. |
| | Date	| A continuous or recurring period of time, of a duration greater than or equal to a day. |
| | Time	| A particular point in the progression of time within an unspecified 24-hour day.| 
| | Duration	| An amount of time; the length of a time span. |
| ID	| |	A character string to identify and distinguish uniquely one instance of an object in an identification scheme from all other objects in the same scheme together with relevant supplementary information. |
| | URI	| A string of characters used to identify (or name) a resource. The main purpose of this identifier is to enable interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. A URI is either a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN). The specific syntax for each is defined by [[RFC 3986]](#references). |
| Indicator | | A list of two mutually exclusive Boolean values that express the only possible states of a property. |
| Measure	| | 	A numeric value determined by measuring an object along with the specified unit of measure. |
| Numeric	| | 	Numeric information that is assigned or is determined by calculation, counting, or sequencing. It does not require a unit of quantity or unit of measure. |
| | Value	| A result of a calculation. |
| | Rate	| A relative speed of change or progress. |
| | Percent	| A representation of a unitless ratio, expressed as parts of a hundred, with 100 percent representing a ratio of 1 to 1. |
| Quantity	| | 	A counted number of non-monetary units possibly including fractions. |
| Text | -	| A character string (i.e., a finite sequence of characters) generally in the form of words of a language. |
| | Name	| A word or phrase that constitutes the distinctive designation of a person, place, thing, or concept. |
| List | | 		A sequence of values. This representation term is used in tandem with another of the listed representation terms.| 
| Abstract	| | 	An element that may represent a concept, rather than a concrete property. This representation term may be used in tandem with another of the listed representation terms. |
| Representation	| | 	An element that acts as a placeholder for alternative representations of the value of a type (see Section 10.7, The Representation pattern, above). |

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** If any word in the representation term is redundant with any word in the property term, one occurrence SHOULD be deleted. (N5R 10-63)

This rule, carried over from 11179, is designed to prevent repeating terms unnecessarily within component names. For example, this rule allows designers to avoid naming an element PersonFirstNameName.

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of a data property SHOULD use an appropriate representation term as found in Table 10-2, Property representation terms.

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of an object property that corresponds to a concept listed in Table 10-2, Property representation terms, SHOULD use a representation term from that table. (N5R 10-65)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** The name of an object property that does not correspond to a concept listed in Table 10-2, Property representation terms SHOULD NOT use a representation term. (N5R 10-66)

## 6.5 Acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon

A [LocalTerm object](#416-localterm-class) introduces an acronym, abbreviation, or jargon term into the namespace to which it belongs. These terms may be used within the name of a model component (in addition to terms defined withn [[OED]](#references)).

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Constraint):** A local term object MUST have a *documentation* property, or a *literal* property, or both. (N5R 10-77)

**Rule 6-0 (CMF,XSD)(Interpretation):** A local term object establishes the meaning of a local term only within the namespace to which it belongs. There MUST NOT be any transitive inheritance of local terminology within schema documents that import the containing schema document.

</br>

# 7. Rules for namespaces

An extension namespace is the kind most commonly created by a NIEM message designer. This section therefore begins with those rules, then adds rules for reference namespaces, and then takes away rules not applicable to subset namespaces and message schema documents.

## 7.1 Rules for extension namespaces

**Rule 7-1 (XSD)(Constraint):** The document must be a [schema document](#definitions), as defined in [[XML Schema Structures]](). (N5R 7-3)

**Rule 7-2 (XSD)(Constraint):** The [document element](#definitions) must be `xs:schema`. (N5R 7-4)

**Rule 7-3 (REF,EXT,SUB)(Constraint):** In XSD, a type definition, element declaration, or attribute declaration MUST be top-level. (N5R 9-10,9-25,9-36,9-48)

All XML Schema top-level types (children of the document element) are required by XML Schema to be named. By requiring these components to be top level, they are forced to be named and are globally reusable.

**Rule 7-4 (XSD)(Constraint):** A schema component that does not define a [*proxy type*](#definitions) MUST have a name ending in "Type" if and only if it is a type definition. (N5R 11-2)

Use of the representation term Type immediately identifies XML types in a NIEM-conformant schema and prevents naming collisions with corresponding XML elements and attributes. The exception for proxy types ensures that simple NIEM-compatible uses of base XML Schema types are familiar to people with XML Schema experience.

**Rule 7-5 (XSD)(Constraint):** A schema component MUST have a name ending in "SimpleType" if and only if it is a simple type definition. (N5R 11-4)

Specific uses of type definitions have similar syntax but very different effects on data definitions. Schemas that clearly identify complex and simple type definitions are easier to understand without tool support. This rule ensures that names of simple types end in SimpleType.

**Rule 7-6 (REF,EXT)(Constraint):** In XSD, a type definition, element declaration, attribute declaration, or `xs:schema` element MUST have a [*data definition*](#definitions).  In CMF, a `Component` object MUST have a `DocumentationText` property. (N5R 9-12,9-26,9-37,9-49,9-82)

The data definition of a schema component is the content of the first occurrence of the element `xs:documentation` that is an immediate child of an occurrence of an element `xs:annotation` that is an immediate child of the element that defines the component.

**Rule 7-7 (XSD)(Constraint):** Prohibited base types: A schema component MUST NOT have any of the following base types:  (N5R 9-2 thru 9-9)
- `xs:ID`
- 'xs:IDREF`
- `xs:IDREFS`
- `xs:anyType`
- `xs:anySimpleType`
- `xs:NOTATION`
- `xs:ENTITY`
- `xs:ENTITES`
- any type in the XML namespace `http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace`

**Rule 7-8 (REF,EXT)(Constraint):** In XSD, an enumeration facet MUST have a [*data definition*](#definitions). In CMF, a `Facet` object MUST have a `DocumentationText` property. (N5R 9-14)

**Rule 7-9 (XSD)(Constraint):** Prohibited list item types: A schema component MUST NOT have an attribute `{}itemType` with any of the following values: (N5R 9-15,9-16,9-17,9-18)

* `xs:ID`
* `xs:IDREF`
* `xs:anySimpleType`
* `xs:ENTITY`

**Rule 7-10 (XSD)(Constraint):** Prohibited union item types: A schema component MUST NOT have an attribute `{}memberTypes` with any of the following values: (N5R 9-19,9-20,9-21,9-22,9-23,9-24)

* `xs:ID`
* `xs:IDREF`
* `xs:IDREFS`
* `xs:anySimpleType`
* `xs:ENTITY`
* `xs:ENTITIES`

**Rule 7-11 (XSD)(Constraint):** No mixed content on complex type or complex content. (N5R 9-27,9-28)

Mixed content allows the mixing of data tags with text. Languages such as XHTML use this syntax for markup of text. NIEM-conformant schemas define XML that is for data exchange, not text markup. Mixed content creates complexity in processing, defining, and constraining content. Well-defined markup languages exist outside NIEM and may be used with NIEM data, and so [*external schema documents*](#definitions) may include mixed content and may be used with NIEM. 

**Rule 7-12 (XSD)(Constraint):** A complex type definition MUST have a `xs:complexContent` or a `xs:simpleContent` child element (N5R 9-29)

XML Schema provides shorthand to defining complex content of a complex type, which is to define the complex type with immediate children that specify elements, or other groups, and attributes. In the desire to normalize schema representation of types and to be explicit, NIEM forbids the use of that shorthand.

**Rule 7-13 (SET)(Constraint):** The base type of a complex type with complex content MUST have complex content. (N5R 9-31,9-32)

This rule addresses a peculiarity of the XML Schema definition language, which allows a complex type to be constructed using xs:complexContent, and yet is derived from a complex type that uses xs:simpleContent. These rules ensure that each type has the content style indicated by the schema.

**Rule 7-14 (XSD)(Constraint):** An untyped elememt or an element of type `xs:anySimpleType` MUST be abstract. (N5R 9-38,9-39)

Untyped element declarations act as wildcards that may carry arbitrary data. By declaring such types abstract, NIEM allows the creation of type independent semantics without allowing arbitrary content to appear in XML instances.

**Rule 7-15 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element type MUST NOT be in the XML Schema namespace or the XML namespace. (N5R 9-40,9-41)

**Rule 7-16 (REF,EXT,SUB)(Constraint):** An element type that is not `xs:anySimpleType` MUST NOT be a simple type. (NSR 9-42)

**Rule 7-17 (XSD)(Constraint):** An attribute declaration MUST have a type. (N5R 9-50)

**Rule 7-18 (XSD)(Constrant):** Prohibited attribute types: A schema component MUST NOT have an attribute `{}type` with any of the following types: (N5R 9-51,9-52,9-53,9-54,9-55,9-56)

* `xs:ID`
* `xs:IDREF`
* `xs:IDREFS`
* `xs:ENTITY`
* `xs:ENTITIES`
* `xs:anySimpleType`

**Rule 7-18 (XSD)(Constraint):** Prohibited schema components: A schema document MUST NOT contain any of the following elements:(N5R 9-59,9-61,9-72,9-73,9-74,9-75,9-76)

* `xs:notation`
* `xs:all`
* `xs:unique`
* `xs:key`
* `xs:keyref`
* `xs:group`
* `xs:attributeGroup`
* `xs:redefine`
* `xs:include`

**Rule 7-19 (EXT,SUB)(Constraint):** An element `xs:sequence` MUST be a child of `xs:extension` or `xs:restriction`. (N5R 9-63)

**Rule 7-20 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element `xs:sequence` MUST have a `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` of 1. (N5R 9-66,9-67)

**Rule 7-21 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element `xs:choice` MUST have a `minOccurs` and `maxOccurs` of 1. (N5R 9-68,9-69)

**Rule 7-22 (XSD)(Constraint):** An XML comment SHOULD NOT appear in the schema. (NSR 9-77)

Since XML comments are not associated with any specific XML Schema construct, there is no standard way to interpret comments. XML Schema annotations should be preferred for meaningful information about components. NIEM specifically defines how information should be encapsulated in NIEM-conformant schemas via xs:annotation elements. Comments do not correspond to any metamodel object.

**Rule 7-23 (XSD)(Constraint):** A child of element `xs:documentation` MUST be text or an XML comment. (N5R 9-78)

**Rule 7-24 (XSD)(Constraint):** A child of element `xs:appinfo` MUST be an element, a comment, or whitespace text. (N5R 9-79)

**Rule 7-25 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element that is a child of `xs:appinfo` MUST have a namespace name. (N5R 9-80)

**Rule 7-26 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element that is a descendent of `xs:appinfo` MUST NOT have the XML Schema namespace. (NSR 9-81)

**Rule 7-27 (XSD)(Constraint):** A schema document MUST define a target namespace. (N5R 9-83)

**Rule 7-28 (XSD)(Constraint):** The value of the attribute `targetNamespace` MUST match the production <*absolute-URI*> as defined by [[RFC 3986]](#references). (N5R 9-84)

This is the XSD version of rule 4-1 for CMF.

**Rule 7-29 (XSD)(Constraint):** A schema document MUST define a prefix for the target namespace URI> (NEW)

**Rule 7-30 (SET)(Constraint):** There MUST be a one-to-one match between namespace prefix and namespace URI among all schema documents in the set. (NEW)

This is the XSD version of rule 4-2 for CMF.  XML Schema permits a schema document set to contain

* schema document A containing `xmlns:foo="http://example.com/MyFoo/"`
* schema document B containing `xmlns:bar="http://example.com/MyFoo/"`
* schema document C containing `xmlns:foo="http://example.com/MyBar/"`

However, these conflicting namespace bindings are not allowed in CMF, and are therefore forbidden in NIEM XSD.

**Rule 7-31 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element `xs:schema` MUST have an attribute `{}version` that is not empty. (N5R 9-85)

This is the XSD version of rule 4-3 for CMF.

**Rule 7-32 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element `xs:import` MUST have an attribute `{}namespace`. (N5R 9-90)

**Rule 7-33 (XSD)(Constraint):** An `xs:import` element MUST must specify a schema document which MUST be a local resource. (NEW)

The schema document may be specified by a `{}schemaLocation` attribute in the `xs:import` element, or by XML Catalog resolution of the `{}namespace` attribute, or both. Requiring a local resource ensures that the component definitions are known and fixed.

**Rule 7-34 (SET)(Constraint):** The schema document set MUST NOT contain two `xs:import` elements with the same `{}namespace` attribute that specify different schema documents. (NEW)

XML Schema permits conflicting imports, but the result is underspecified, and often causes errors that are very hard to detect and diagnose.

**Rule 7-34 (SET)(Constraint):** A schema document set must be complete. (N5R 9-91)

An XML Schema document set defines an XML Schema that may be used to validate an XML document. This rule ensures that a schema document set under consideration contains definitions for everything that it references; it has everything necessary to do a complete validation of XML documents, without any unresolved references. Note that some tools may allow validation of documents using partial schemas, when components that are not present are not exercised by the XML document under validation. Such a schema does not meet qualify as a conformant schema document set.

**Rule 7-35 (XSD)(Constraint):** The namespace of a type referenced by any of the following schema attributes MUST be the target namespace, the XML Schma namespace, or imported: (N5R 9-92,9-93,9-94,9-95,9-96,9-97)

* `type`
* `base`
* `itemType`
* `memberTypes`
* `ref`
* `substitutionGroup`

The XML Schema definition language requires that, when a schema document references a component in some other namespace, it must use `xs:import` to import the namespace of the referenced component. The use of `xs:import` is described by [[XML Schema Structures]](#references) Section 4.2.3, References to schema components across namespaces.

Some tools do not enforce this constraint; one such tool carries imports from a schema document into schema documents that it imports. This has the potential to introduce incompatibility into schema documents and schema document sets that exercise this bug. To maintain compatibility across tool sets, this requirement is an explicit rule for NIEM-conformant schemas.

**Rule 7-36 (XSD)(Constraint):** A complex type definition must be an object type, an association type, an adapter type, or an augmentation type. (N5R 10-1)

The rules in this document use the name of a type as the key indicator of the type‚Äôs category. This makes the rules much simpler than doing a deep examination of each type (and its base types) to identify its category. For complex types, the names follow a pattern:

* Name ends with AdapterType ‚Üí type is an adapter type.
* Name ends with AssociationType ‚Üí type is an association type.
* Name ends with AugmentationType ‚Üí type is an augmentation type.
* Otherwise ‚Üí type is an object type.

In a NIEM-conformant schema, an [object type](#definitions) is a complex type definition, an instance of which asserts the existence of an object. An object type represents some kind of object: a thing with its own lifespan that has some existence. The object may or may not be a physical object. It may be a conceptual object.

An [adapter type](#definitions) is a NIEM-conformant type that adapts external components for use within NIEM. An external adapter type creates a new class of object that embodies a single concept composed of external components. A NIEM-conformant schema defines an external adapter type.

**Rule 7-37 (REF,EXT,SUB)(Constraint):** An object type with complex content MUST be derived from structures:ObjectType or from another object type. (N5R 10-2)

**Rule 7-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** An `xs:import` element importing an external schema document MUST own the attribute `appinfo:externalImportIndicator` with a value of `true`. (NEW)

An [external schema document](#definitions) is any schema document that is not 

* a reference schema document,
* an extension schema document, 
* a subset schema document,
* a message schema document, or
* a schema document that has the structures namespace as its target namespace.

There are a variety of commonly used standards that are represented in XML Schema. Such schemas are generally not NIEM-conformant. NIEM-conformant schemas may reference components defined by these external schema documents.

A schema component defined by an external schema document may be called an external component. A NIEM-conformant type may use external components in its definition. There are two ways to integrate external components into a NIEM-conformant schema:

* An [external adapter](#definitions) type may be constructed from externally-defined elements and attributes. A goal of this method is to represent, as a single unit, a set of data that embodies a single concept from an external standard.

* A type that is not an external adapter type, and which is defined by an extension, subset, or message schema document, may incorporate externally-defined attribute

**Rule 7-0 (REF,EXT)(Constraint):** An `xs:import` element importing an external schema document MUST be a documented component. (N5R 10-7)

A NIEM-conformant schema has well-known documentation points. Therefore, a schema that imports a NIEM-conformant namespace need not provide additional documentation for the imported namespace. However, when an external schema document is imported, appropriate documentation must be provided on the xs:import element. This ensures that documentation for all external schema documents will be both available and accessible in a consistent manner.

**Rule 7-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** A type definition MUST have a name ending in "AdapterType" if and only if it is an adapter type. (N5R 10-8)

An external adapter type is a NIEM-conformant type that adapts external components for use within NIEM. An external adapter type creates a new class of object that embodies a single concept composed of external components. A NIEM-conformant schema defines an external adapter type.

An external adapter type should contain the information from an external standard to express a complete concept. This expression should be composed of content entirely from an external schema document. Most likely, the external schema document will be based on an external standard with its own legacy support.

In the case of an external expression that is in the form of model groups, attribute groups, or types, additional elements and type components may be created in an external schema document, and the external adapter type may use those components.

In normal (conformant) type definition, a reference to an attribute or element is a reference to a documented component. Within an external adapter type, the references to the attributes and elements being adapted are references to undocumented components. These components must be documented to provide comprehensibility and interoperability. Since documentation made available by nonconformant schemas is undefined and variable, documentation of these components is required at their point of use, within the conformant schema.

**Rule 7-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** An external adapter type definition MUST be a complex type definition with complex content that extends structures:ObjectType, and that uses xs:sequence as its top-level compositor. (N5R 10-9)

**Rule 7-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** An element reference that appears within an external adapter type MUST have a target namespace that is imported as external. (N5R 10-10)

**Rule 7-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** An external adapter type definition MUST NOT be a base type definition. (N5R 10-11, 10-12)

**Rule 7-0 (REF,EXT)(Constraint):** An external attribute use MUST be a documented component with a non-empty data definition. (N5R 10-14)

**Rule 7-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** An attribute use schema component MUST NOT have an {attribute declaration} with an ID type. (N5R 10-15)

NIEM schemas use structures:id to enable references between components. Each NIEM-defined complex type in a reference or extension schema document must incorporate a definition for structures:id. [XML] Section 3.3.1, Attribute Types entails that a complex type may have no more than one ID attribute. This means that an external attribute use must not be an ID attribute.

The term "attribute use schema component" is defined by [[XML Schema Structures]](#references) Section 3.5.1, The Attribute Use Schema Component. Attribute type ID is defined by[[XML]](#references) Section 3.3.1, Attribute Types.

**Rule 7-0 (REF,EXT)(Constraint):** An external attribute use MUST be a documented component with a non-empty data definition. (N5R 10-16)

**Rule 7-0 (XSD)(Constraint):** A proxy type MUST have the designated structure. It MUST use xs:extension. It MUST NOT use xs:attribute. It MUST include exactly one xs:attributeGroup reference, which must be to structures:SimpleObjectAttributeGroup. (N5R 10-20)

A [proxy type](#definitions) is not a model component. It is a convenience complex type definition wrapper for a simple type in the XML Schema namespace; for example, `niem-xs:token` is a proxy type for `xs:token`.  Unlike other complex type definitions, proxy types have the same local name as the builtin simple type. This is done to make conformant schemas more understandable to people that are familiar with the names of the XML Schema namespace simple types.

**Rule 7-0 (REF,EXT,SUB)(Constraint):** The type definition for an [association class](#definitions) MUST be derived from `structures:AssociationType`. (N5R 10-21)
